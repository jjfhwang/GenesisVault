# GenesisVault: Secure and Efficient Data Storage Solution

GenesisVault is a robust and highly performant data storage solution built in Rust, designed for scenarios requiring strong encryption and efficient data retrieval. It provides a foundation for building secure applications that demand persistent and reliable data management.

This repository provides the core building blocks for a hardened data vault. GenesisVault leverages Rust's memory safety and concurrency features to deliver a secure and efficient storage layer. It prioritizes data integrity through strong encryption algorithms and provides mechanisms for verifiable data consistency. The architecture is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing developers to customize the vault's behavior to suit specific application needs. GenesisVault aims to be a trusted base for building secure and confidential data-centric applications, fostering trust and privacy in data handling.

GenesisVault distinguishes itself from other storage solutions by offering a combination of strong security guarantees, high performance, and developer-friendly APIs. The use of Rust eliminates common vulnerabilities associated with memory management, reducing the risk of data corruption and security breaches. The carefully chosen encryption algorithms and key management strategies ensure data confidentiality at rest and in transit. Furthermore, the modular design allows developers to integrate GenesisVault seamlessly into existing systems or build new applications on top of it. The focus on data integrity and verifiable consistency makes GenesisVault ideal for applications requiring high levels of assurance, such as financial systems, healthcare records, and sensitive personal information storage.

The underlying architecture of GenesisVault is designed with scalability and maintainability in mind. It supports various storage backends, allowing developers to choose the most appropriate option for their specific requirements. The API is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, providing developers with the necessary tools to manage data securely and efficiently. The comprehensive documentation and examples provided in this repository further enhance the developer experience, making it easy to get started with GenesisVault.

## Key Features

*   **End-to-End Encryption:** GenesisVault encrypts data at rest and in transit using AES-256 encryption with authenticated encryption modes (e.g., AES-GCM). This ensures that data remains confidential even if the underlying storage is compromised. Key derivation is handled using Argon2id, a memory-hard password hashing algorithm, to protect against brute-force attacks.

*   **Data Integrity Verification:** Each data entry is associated with a cryptographic hash (SHA-256) to ensure data integrity. This allows for verifiable data consistency and detection of any unauthorized modifications. The hash is stored alongside the encrypted data.

*   **Configurable Storage Backend:** GenesisVault supports multiple storage backends, including file-based storage (using Rust's `std::fs`) and potentially more advanced options like key-value stores (e.g., RocksDB) through feature flags and modular implementations.

*   **Secure Key Management:** Keys are managed using Rust's `ring` crate for secure cryptographic operations. Key derivation functions (KDFs) such as Argon2id are used to generate encryption keys from user-provided passwords or secrets. Salted keys are stored securely within the vault's metadata.

*   **Concurrency-Safe Access:** GenesisVault leverages Rust's concurrency primitives (e.g., `Mutex`, `RwLock`) to ensure thread-safe access to the underlying data storage, preventing data corruption and race conditions in multi-threaded environments.

*   **Error Handling and Logging:** Comprehensive error handling is implemented using Rust's `Result` type. Detailed logging is provided via the `log` crate, allowing developers to monitor vault activity and troubleshoot any issues. Log levels are configurable.

*   **Modular Architecture:** The codebase is designed with a modular architecture, allowing for easy extension and customization. New storage backends and encryption algorithms can be added without modifying the core vault functionality.

## Technology Stack

*   **Rust:** The core programming language, providing memory safety, concurrency, and performance.
*   **ring:** A comprehensive and trustworthy cryptographic library for secure key generation, encryption, and hashing.
*   **log:** A simple logging facade that allows developers to easily integrate logging into their applications.
*   **Argon2:** Used for secure password hashing and key derivation to protect against brute-force attacks.
*   **serde:** For serialization and deserialization of data to/from various formats (e.g., JSON) if metadata needs to be stored.
*   **tokio:** For asynchronous runtime and I/O if async operations are needed in the future.

## Installation

1.  **Install Rust:** Ensure you have Rust installed on your system. You can download and install Rust from [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

2.  **Clone the Repository:** Clone the GenesisVault repository from GitHub:
    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/GenesisVault.git

3.  **Navigate to the Directory:** Change your current directory to the GenesisVault repository:
    cd GenesisVault

4.  **Build the Project:** Build the project using Cargo:
    cargo build

5.  **Run Tests (Optional):** Run the unit tests to ensure that the code is working correctly:
    cargo test

## Configuration

GenesisVault can be configured using environment variables or a configuration file (e.g., `vault.toml`). The following environment variables are supported:

*   `GENESISVAULT_STORAGE_PATH`: Specifies the path to the storage directory (default: `./vault_data`).
*   `GENESISVAULT_LOG_LEVEL`: Sets the logging level (e.g., `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`). Defaults to `info`.

To configure using a TOML file:



Environment variables take precedence over configuration file settings.

## Usage

Example code:



This snippet demonstrates creating a vault, storing data, and retrieving data. Replace `"./vault_data"` with the desired storage path. The `store` and `retrieve` functions handle encryption and decryption automatically. Further API documentation will be provided in a separate document.
